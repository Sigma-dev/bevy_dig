Steps to MVP:
Step 1 Get one editable chunk to reliably generate: X
 - Get one editable chunk to unreliably generate V

Step 2 Make a character controller that can walk and collide with it
 - Try a traditional physics approach




Keep in mind:
There must be no freezes while editing the terrain, and the game should be able to play at 144hz easily.

Performance tricks available:
Splitting the terrain into smaller size
Keep the mesh data on the GPU side and approximate collisions with the voxel data
