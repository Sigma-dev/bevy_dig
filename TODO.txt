BUG FIXES:
- Sometimes the mesh has missing triangles -> Investigate
- Sometimes the player falls through the mesh(probably the bad kinematic collision and the slim collider) -> Use the other kinematic solver sent on discord


IMPROVEMENTS:
Remove as much delay as possible from click to mesh instantiation -> ask on discord
Make the green grass top shader. -> use solution from discord
