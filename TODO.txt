BUG FIXES:
- Sometimes the mesh has missing triangles -> Investigate
- Sometimes the player falls through the mesh(probably the bad kinematic collision and the slim collider) -> Use the other kinematic solver sent on discord -> it is slightly better, but clipping still occurs regularly


IMPROVEMENTS:
Remove as much delay as possible from click to mesh instantiation -> ask on discord
Make the green grass top shader. -> use solution from discord
Make the compute shader process multiple chunks from the queue per frame, it shouldn't be that hard to implement since chunks have a fixed input size and output size
