//! A kinematic character controller framework inspired by the [bevy-tnua](https://github.com/idanarye/bevy-tnua/tree/main) project
//! While also taking inspiration and ideas from the [Avian Physics](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1124043933886976171) channel in the official Bevy Discord server.\
//!
//! Please note that all components within this module are prefixed with `KCC` to make it clear that
//! they are part of the Kinematic Character Controller framework.
